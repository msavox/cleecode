## Install

**macOS** (Homebrew):

```bash
brew install msavox/clee/clee
```

Or download the archive for your platform from the assets below, unpack it, and put `clee`
somewhere on your `PATH`.

## Platform status

**macOS** is the supported platform: developed, tested and used there daily, on both Apple
Silicon and Intel.

The **Linux** and **Windows** binaries are compiled and started by CI — they build, launch,
and print `--version` — but they have had **no interactive testing at all**. Treat them as
experimental, and please open an issue for whatever breaks. Building from source works too;
see the README for the system dependencies.

## First run

The file-tree icons need a Nerd Font. The bundled one installs with:

```bash
clee --install-font
```

Then restart your terminal. `clee --help` lists the rest.
